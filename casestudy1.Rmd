## CSV reading and cleaning
### *Code below is to read in Beers.csv and Breweries.csv and count up the na's.*
```{r}
beerdf=read.csv("C:\\Users\\malco\\Documents\\MDS\\MDS_6306_DDS\\CaseStudy1\\Beers.csv",header=TRUE)
breweriesdf=read.csv("C:\\Users\\malco\\Documents\\MDS\\MDS_6306_DDS\\CaseStudy1\\Breweries.csv",header=TRUE)

```

# **Question 1.  How many breweries are present in each state?**
# *With the breweriesdf dataframe, we grouped by state, then did a count on the Brewery factor which gives us a total brewery count by state.*
```{r}
#Created for data in ascending order
set.seed(6)
stateSum=breweriesdf%>%group_by(State)%>%summarise(Brewery_count=n())
orderedstateSum<-stateSum[order(-stateSum$Brewery_count),]
write.csv(orderedstateSum,file="/Users/malco/Documents/MDS/MDS_6306_DDS/CaseStudy1/orderedstateSum.csv",row.names=FALSE)

#Top 10 ordered bar chart
top10=head(orderedstateSum,10)
top10%>%ggplot(aes(x=reorder(State,-Brewery_count),y=Brewery_count))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="Blue")+
  geom_text(aes(label=Brewery_count), vjust=1.6, color="white", size=3.5)+
  ggtitle("Top 10 States with most Breweries")+xlab("States")+ylab("Count of Breweries")

```

# **2. Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print first and last 6 observations.**
## *Before merging, we renamed Brew_ID and name to Brewery_id,Brewery_name in Breweriesdf.  In Beers, we renamed Name to Beer_name to avoid conflicts.*
```{r}
breweriesdf <- breweriesdf %>% rename(
    Brewery_id = Brew_ID,
    Brewery_name = Name)

beerdf <- beerdf %>% rename(
  Beer_name = Name
)

combineddf<-merge(breweriesdf,beerdf, by="Brewery_id",all = TRUE)
top6merge<-head(combineddf)
bottom6merge<-tail(combineddf)
view(top6merge,title = "Top 6 head data for merged dataset")
view(bottom6merge,title = "Bottom 6 head data for merged dataset")
sum(is.na(combineddf$ABV))
sum(is.na(combineddf$IBU))
```

# **3.  Address the missing values in each column.**
## *We chose the mice library to address missing values in ABV and IBU. We imputed using all but the predm columns to create the new values. We then wrote out the finished data set with imputed data to a .csv so it could be read in for the rest of the code to reduce run time.*
```{r}
init = mice(combineddf, maxit=0)
predM = init$predictorMatrix
predM[, c("Beer_name", "Beer_ID", "Ounces", "Brewery_name")]=0
imp<-mice(combineddf, m=5, predictorMatrix = predM)
nona <- complete(imp)
nona$State<-trimws(nona$State)
write.csv(nona,file="/Users/malco/Documents/MDS/MDS_6306_DDS/CaseStudy1/nona.csv",row.names=FALSE)
nona=read.csv(file="/Users/malco/Documents/MDS/MDS_6306_DDS/CaseStudy1/nona.csv",header=TRUE)

```

# **4. Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness #unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare. ABV,IBU.**
## *The State column data in the nona data frame had a space that had to be removed with str_trim.  A new df was created for the median values for both ABV and IBU. The dataframe was then ordered to create a top 10 list and bar chart of both ABV and IBU.*
```{r}
nona$State = as.character(nona$State)
nona$State = str_trim(nona$State)

#Dataframe of just State,ABV,IBU
medianABVIBU<-nona%>%group_by(State)%>%summarize(medianABV=median(ABV),medianIBU=median(IBU))
head(medianABVIBU)

#Code for Top 10 highes ABV by State                          
top10medABV=head(medianABVIBU,10)
top10medABV%>%ggplot(aes(x=reorder(State,-medianABV),y=medianABV))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="blue")+geom_text(aes(label=medianABV), vjust=1.6, color="white", size=3)+
ggtitle("Highest Median Alcohol by Volumes by State")+xlab("States")+ylab("Alcohol by Volume")

```

# **5. Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?**
## *Colorado had the highest ABV and IBU values.  The maxABV and maxIBU containe the top state value.*
```{r}
#Code to selct by ABV and IBU and find max value
maxABV<-nona%>%group_by(State)
maxIBU<-nona%>%group_by(State)
maxABV[which.max(maxABV$ABV), ]
maxIBU[which.max(maxIBU$IBU), ]

```

# **6. Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.**
## *The justABV variable holds only the ABV data.  That is used to plot the raw data histogram for Alcohol by volume for the entire sample population. The standard hist() was used to create a simple plot with a normal curve.*
```{r}
x <- nona$ABV
h<-hist(x,
     main="Histogram of Alcohol by Volume",
     xlab="Alcohol by Volume",
     ylab="Beer population",
     col="blue",
     border="black"
     )
xfit<-seq(min(x),max(x),length=40)
yfit<-dnorm(xfit,mean=mean(x),sd=sd(x))
yfit <- yfit*diff(h$mids[1:2])*length(x)
lines(xfit, yfit, col="blue", lwd=2)

```

## *The summary(justABV) was used to create the summary statistics and a box plot using ggplot. *
```{r}
justABV<-nona%>%select(ABV)
summary(justABV*100)
justABV%>%ggplot(aes(x="", y=ABV,fill=ABV))+geom_boxplot(width=.4,fill="lightblue")+ylab("ABV")+ggtitle("Box plot of ABV Summary Statistics")+xlab(NULL)

```

## *justIBU was used to capture summary statistics for IBU including a boxplot.*
```{r}
justIBU<-nona%>%select(IBU)
summary(justIBU)
justIBU%>%ggplot(aes(x="", y=IBU,fill=IBU))+geom_boxplot(width=.4,fill="lightblue")+ylab("IBU")+ggtitle("Box plot of IBU Summary Statistics")

```

# **7. Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.  Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.**
## *The scatter plots for this data was not conclusive and difficult to see patterns. This question is addressed further down.*
```{r}
qplot(seq_along(nona$ABV),nona$ABV,main="Scatter Plot of ABV",xlab="ABV")
qplot(seq_along(nona$IBU),nona$IBU, main="Scatter Plot of IBU",xlab="IBU")

styledf<-nona%>%select(State,Style,ABV,IBU)
styledf%>%ggplot(aes(x=ABV,y=IBU,color=State))+geom_point()+ggtitle("ABV vs IBU")

```

## *Jason's code to support usmap libary.  This code was modified to include a sum of breweries by state.  That new column was later used to show a us map of number of breweries by state.*
```{r}
statesum = count(nona, vars = State)
brewerysum=breweriesdf%>%group_by(State)%>%summarise(Brewery_count=n())

temp = statepop
statesum$vars = as.character(statesum$vars)
statesum$vars = str_trim(statesum$vars)

# **8. Use KNN - For final presentation. Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect #to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA). Classify IPA vs Regular Ale by ABV and IBU.**

## *KNN was used to classify all ales into either IPA or Ale using ABV and IBU.  A training set and test set were created (80/20) and 90 values of k were tested over 100 iterations to determine the best k value for this model which is 5.*
